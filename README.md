## About The Project
This project was a terminal-based '21 Card Game' I made in C++ for PointClickCareâ€™s Early Tech Talent Incubator Software Engineering Summer Program.

> Note: This program makes heavy use of ANSI escape codes (clearing the console, applying text colors). It is advised you run the program in a terminal/terminal emulator that supports ANSI escape codes. 
> A recommended method of running the program is [this Replit console](https://replit.com/@teddycitroos/21-Game?v=1).

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
* Download a C++ compiler (e.g. g++ from [MinGW](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases) for Windows)

### Compiling
* Compile the program in cmd/terminal using valid syntax for the compiler you have installed.
* g++ example:
  ```sh
  g++ main.cpp -o main
  ```

### Execution
* Execute the program in cmd/terminal using valid syntax for the compiler you have installed.
* g++ example:
  ```sh
  .\main.exe
  ```

### Simpler alternatives
1. [Replit](https://replit.com/@teddycitroos/21-Game?v=1)
2. Copy-pasting ```src/main.cpp``` into an online C++ compiler (e.g. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)), then running the code

## Gameplay
Note: These screenshots are taken on the Replit console, where the program was run.

The game is entirely-terminal based. It takes typed user input at numerous points.

Input lines are color-coded using ANSI escape codes.

Apart from the name prompt at the start, all options/actions are display in a numbered list. Users make their choice by entering the corresponding number.

At most points, users will receive a 'PRESS ENTER TO CONTINUE' prompt. It takes whatever keys are pressed, along with the enter key, as input and moves on. The 'input' is discarded

In each game, after a move is made, this display is refreshed.

When an ending has been determined, a relevant ending message is displayed.

After an ending, the replay prompt is delivered. Choosing 'no' terminates the program. Choosing 'yes' resets the game state and starts a new game.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
### Completed
- [x] Initial terminal-based game loop
  - [x] Player vs Dealer logic
  - [x] Dealer turn logic
  - [x] Basic win/loss/tie resolution
  - [x] Replay option/prompt
- [x] Hand system
  - [x] Card drawing & deck management
  - [x] Statistics tracker (win/loss count, hand total)
- [x] AI Players
  - [x] 'Enemy' struct, objects, functions
  - [x] Enemy stay/draw card logic 
- [x] 'No instant wins' rule toggle + logic
- [x] Terminal UI
  - [x] Console-clearing with ANSI escape codes/system calls
  - [x] Color-coded text input and output via ANSI escape codes
- [x] Refactor into modular code

### Future Developments
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality for persistent game state (web version could leverage session/local storage)
- [ ] Difficulty modes for AI enemies; 'confidence', 'optimism', etc.
- [ ] GUI version using C++ & libraries like SFML or Qt, or Java & Swing, or Unity Game Engine, etc.
- [ ] Sound support (voicelines, sound effects)  
- [ ] Networked multiplayer support (likely in a webapp)
- [ ] Custom rule editor (e.g. double down, insurance, etc.)  
- [ ] Card-counting challenge mode
