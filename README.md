# 21-Game
The terminal-based '21 Card Game' I made in C++ for PointClickCareâ€™s Early Tech Talent Incubator Software Engineering Summer Program.

> Note: This program makes heavy use of ANSI escape codes (clearing the console, applying text colors). It is advised you run the program in a terminal/terminal emulator that supports ANSI escape codes
> A recommended method of running the program is [this Replit console](https://replit.com/@johnmannul/21-Game?v=1).

# Setup options (in order of recommendation):
1. [Replit](https://replit.com/@johnmannul/21-Game?v=1)
2. Copy-pasting ```src/main.cpp``` into an online C++ compiler (e.g. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)), then running the code
3. Download a C++ compiler (e.g. g++ from [MinGW](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases) for Windows). Compile the program in cmd/terminal (e.g. ```g++ main.cpp -o main```), then execute (e.g. ```.\main.exe```)

# I hope you enjoy my **21 Game**!
